How to compile
- install cmake
- open terminal emulator and make this:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake [options] ..

Options are:

-DQT4BUILD=1 or 0 if you wand Qt4 or Qt5 build
-DSDL1BUILD=1 or 0 if you wand SDL1.2 or SDL2 build

If something going wrong, fix it - install Qt and sdl libraries and headers
Optionally you can install zlib libs and headers for more functional
And...
	make
Result should be './build/xpeccy' executable file

Linux and MacOSX users can make a deb/rpm/dmg package:
	make package
...or install it in /usr/local/ (linux only):
	make install

By default there is only ZX Spectrum 48K romset w/o TRDOS.

PS: DON'T try to build it under Windows. I'm serious.
